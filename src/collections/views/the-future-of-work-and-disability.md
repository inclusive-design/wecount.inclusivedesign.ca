The Future of Work and Disability project brought together a study group of fifteen people, many with lived experience of disabilities, with researchers, artificial intelligence (AI) experts, data scientists, employment organizations and others engaged in the data ecosystem. The goal of the group was to understand and examine intersecting topics of AI, automation, standards and employment as they mainly relate to persons with disabilities.

# Our Objectives

The Future of Work and Disability objectives were to:

* Explore, understand and draw insights into how artificial intelligence and other smart technologies affect persons with disabilities and limit or improve their opportunities and well-being with regards to employment.
* Produce a report that will share the insights gained through the workshop activities.

# Our Process

The study group met weekly for eight weeks in late 2020 and early 2021 and also collaborated asynchronously using platforms such as Google Drive and Canvas. Three themes were explored—each with a webinar module and a research activity module.

The final activity of the group is to co-create a report on their understandings that can be used to help develop standards and regulations that support diversity within employment data systems. Accessibility Standards Canada (ASC) will use the report to inform best practices and policies for AI use in the workplace.

# Our Contributors

The Future of Work and Disability had expert collaborators many of whom identify as having a disability formed a study group that was comprised of fourteen individuals, many with lived experiences of disability and/or knowledge of the AI field. The group was selected through a call for participation from the IDRC, and a selection process was used to ensure that there were diverse perspectives within the group for learning, collaborating and creation of the final report. Experts include:

*Chris Butler*  

*Theodore (Ted) Cooke*  

*Katherine Gallagher*  

*Kevin Keane*  

*Mala Naraine*  

*Runa Patel*  

*Sricamalan (Sri) Pathmanathan, M.A., M.Sc.*

In addition to our report to Accessibility Standards Canada, we created:

* **Learning opportunities from our webinars**
* **Badges that can be used by learners to demonstrate their proficiency in the field**
* **A learning program that will be publicly available at the close of the project**

# FWD Webinar Series

The Future of Work and Disability project study group explored thee themes over six modules of study and research. The final two modules were dedicated collaboration and production or the report.

## Risks and Opportunities of AI, Smart Systems and Automation

This theme introduced how AI creates both barriers and new opportunities for persons with disabilities in the hiring, training and retention of employees.

## Addressing Bias in ML Models on Candidate Selection

In this theme, the group learned about how machine learning models are not neutral but rather often reinforce biases present in the real world. We focused on how the algorithms responsible for screening resumés are biased and how they adversely affect persons with disabilities in the job application process and developed a preliminary understanding of the policy issues at stake within this area of algorithmic bias. Our panel of experts navigated us through these urgent subjects.

#### Activity

In this module, we brainstormed and worked through practical scenarios and challenges related to policies and standards around employment, disability and AI. Abhishek Gupta helped guide us through this collaborative activity (co-design). Abhishek introduced and framed the co-design activity that engaged teams and encouraged them to work through practical situations and challenges related to policies and standards around employment, disability and AI. 

##### Challenges

1. As there are now an increased number of people working remotely, there has been an increase in the use of remote workplace productivity monitoring. The use of traditional metrics in evaluation of employee productivity can affect people with disabilities more so when things like tone of message, frequency of messages and speed of responses can be used in evaluation, such as on Slack channels by an automated bot for a sales team’s performance. What are some ways that we can create more inclusive metrics?
2. In the hiring process, there were a lot of discussions during the previous module on the potential places where discrimination can enter the picture. In the use of AI, firms have an additional veil that they can wear because the systems are not human-interpretable. What accountability measures can we request that make disparate outcomes more explicit, especially in ensuring compliance to legal standards like the Canadian Human Rights Act?
3. Privacy with disability data has severe implications because of smaller sample sizes, so traditional techniques like k-anonymity don’t work well. Disclosing such data to employers to request for accommodations is essential but creates privacy risks. In the previous module, we covered the subject of potentially sharing such data with a third-party data trust that can help track hiring outcomes to make assessments on whether discrimination might be taking place. From a public trust and policy perspective, what measures will permit more open data sharing with data trusts that doesn’t compromise the privacy rights of people, especially those with disabilities whose data carries extra sensitivity?

## Making AI Inclusive for Hiring and HR

In this theme, our panel discussion highlighted some of the potential problems that AI raises in the hiring process and brainstormed ideas to make this process more inclusive for persons with disabilities.

### Module 6: Workshop 

In this module, participants had the opportunity to gather insights from previous modules and apply them to thinking critically about nugget.ai’s operations as a skills measurement technology company. As such, this module served as a real-world case study through which participants analyzed and reflected on the business decisions of nugget.ai.

Marian Pitel and Melissa Pike, members of nugget.ai’s science team, guided the presentation and activity, taking turns explaining key stages in nugget.ai’s operations and highlighting decisions and considerations that the nugget.ai team have had to make at these stages.

  
At each stage, Marian and Melissa worked with the whole group in identifying the advantages of nugget.ai’s approach and any areas of opportunities. The participants were encouraged to reflect on nugget.ai’s business decisions, leaning on lessons that have emerged from the study group’s previous modules.

#### Activity

{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTDm5iyml0k" %}

We discussed ideal candidates based on David Dame’s YouTube video, which focuses on the following questions:

* How can an organization leverage the competitive advantage of using a candidate’s differences to their success?
* How can organizations begin to think differently about what it means to be “ideal” for the job?
