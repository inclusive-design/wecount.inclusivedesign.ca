Nowadays, when word cloud centres build wordles based on people's answers to a question, majority answers are emphasized while minority answers fade in the background. In order to make minority voices being heard, the development team is building a wordle tool that users have options to flip the algorithm to highlight either the majority or minority answers.

Currently, this wordle tool includes 2 steps below. The further development will be based on the feedback.

1. People submit their answers to a question.

2. The wordle is built dynamically by polling submitted answers every 5 seconds. By default, the less frequent words will be highlighted. When the "conventional weighting" box is checked, the more frequent words will be highlighted.
