The IDRC has submitted a proposal to the W3C to establish a Community Group to discuss and develop portable personal data preferences. More information is available at the [W3C community blog](https://www.w3.org/community/blog/2021/06/01/proposed-group-portable-personal-data-preferences-community-group/).

The current status of the community group is "proposed." Votes to promote the group to official status are underway (as of Jun 9, 2021). To vote for the group:

1. Go to the W3C Community Group Page, specifically to the [Support Newly Proposed Groups section](https://www.w3.org/community/#support)
2. Look for the "Portable Personal Data Preferences Community Group" heading
3. Click the "Support This Group" button

Note that you will need a W3C account to proceed. Either use your existing account, or create a new one if you are so inclined.

Also, once the group is official, consider joining it. There will be an announcement when the group becomes official.
