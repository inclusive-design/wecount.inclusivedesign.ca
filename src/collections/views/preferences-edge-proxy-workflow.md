The development team is defining the workflow supported by the Personal Data Storage, or Preferences server, where the user makes save/retrieve requests for their preferences while on a static site, such as when a user changes their UI Options (UIO) preferences and wants to save them.

The workflow describes the requests, responses, payloads and database structures needed to support static access and single sign-on workflows. It includes an OAuth2 authorization sequence where users are authenticated by a third-party single sign-on (SSO) provider, such as Google or GitHub.
