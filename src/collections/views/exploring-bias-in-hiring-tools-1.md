The IDRC, with the support of Kessler Foundation and Microsoft, has launched ODD (Optimizing Diversity with Disability). The goal of ODD is to investigate bias in hiring algorithms using non-disability-specific and synthesized disability-specific employment data. In the next year, we will work with the community to create synthetic models of resume and job seeker data that will be tested with online hiring systems. Our objective is to better understand how to mitigate algorithmic bias and to use this knowledge in future projects to develop algorithms that can optimize diversity.
