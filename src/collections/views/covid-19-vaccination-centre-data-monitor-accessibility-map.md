## Background: We Count 

As data becomes the primary basis for determining truth and value, and data science drives the opportunities and risks of the digital economy, people with disabilities are likely to become increasingly marginalized if their needs are not considered. The current data ecosystem is an evolving system, used to collect and analyze data to provide insights into the needs and habits of its users. It focuses on the needs of the majority. As people experiencing disabilities are very different from each other, there are no adequate representative sample groups for predictive analytics. Their needs are either not captured in data, eliminated from the data set as outliers, or overwhelmed by majority data. An inclusive and balanced data ecosystem ensures that the needs of its minorities are valued and not overlooked. 

We Count, a project of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD University, was created to address bias, discrimination and barriers to participation and employment for persons with disabilities within the field of data science and data-driven systems. The We Count project is addressing these issues by: 

1. Making sure people with lived experience of disability can participate in shaping data science 
2. Addressing data gaps and biases 
3. Co-designing protections against data abuse and misuse 
4. Co-creating more equitable decision supports

# Introduction 

Access barriers at COVID-19 testing centres​ 

With the evolving COVID-19 public health measures and rapid emergence of testing centres, it was difficult for members of the public to obtain information on how to get tested for the virus. With the access barriers and increased difficulty in getting tested, there were lower testing rates among persons with disabilities as well as a direct infection risk at the centres. For example, it was difficult to obtain key accessibility information such as, wheelchair-accessible entrances, interpreters, and accommodations for people who are not able to wait in line.  

This problem highlights the data gap, policy and design gap​ in accessing a COVID-19 testing centre.  

Ontario Digital Service maintains an open dataset describing testing centres in the province​, however, more detailed data is needed that requires direct engagement with the disability community. 

Inclusive Data Systems 

* AI reiterates and reinforces the fundamental problems of data systems: erasure and exclusion of minorities and outliers​ 
* Data systems will only be representative, relevant, and useful if communities can make decisions about how data is structured, used, and acted upon​ 
* Our response: ​ 
* Direct participation through inclusive co-design ​ 
* Technologies that distribute ownership and preserve diversity​ 
* seeks to understand the data practices of groups working to further the interests of members of the disability community. Data practices refer to the goals motivating these groups, as well as the tools and methods they employ when carrying out data-related projects, such as creating reports and advocacy campaigns.
