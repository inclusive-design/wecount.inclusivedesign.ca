## Background 

With the evolving COVID-19 public health measures and rapid emergence of testing centres, there were several access barriers to obtain information to get tested for COVID-19. In a study conducted on behalf of Statistics Canada, it was reported that approximately 1 in 10 participants were not able to access COVID-19 related testing or medical attention due to their long-term condition or disability (Yang, Dorrance & Aitken, 2020). The Ontario Digital Service (2021) maintains an open dataset describing COVID-19 testing centres in the province​ with basic data on the centre amenities, such as location, hours of operation, walk-in availability, and accessibility (yes/no response). More detailed data on accessibility in the testing centres is needed, which requires direct engagement with the disability community. This highlights the data, policy, and design gap in accessing a COVID-19 testing centre.  

## Map Demonstration 

This map demonstration was created to show how these data gaps can be addressed, providing a way to find accessibility information that is not included in these datasets. The map demonstration uses an example dataset and demonstrates how data visualization can be designed in an accessible format. Accessibility features in the map include: Accessible Entrances, Accessible Washrooms, Accessible Parking, Individual Service and Wait Accommodations.  

1. A base map with markers over the testing centers 
2. Each marker will be clickable and include the following: 

* Accessibility features  
* Commuting options to the location 
* Contact information 
* Street view/photos linking to Google Maps 
* Comments and insights   

### Workflow for COVID-19 Map interface

The following images show that data can be presented visually through placement on the map and use of colour as well as in text formats that can be read or accessed  by assistive technology. The information is presentation is flexible without compromising the design of the map and allows the individual to choose how to engage with the information.
