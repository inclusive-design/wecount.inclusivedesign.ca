Marian Pitel and Melissa Pike, members of nugget.ai’s science team, will guide the presentation and activity, taking turns explaining key stages in nugget.ai’s operations and highlighting decisions and considerations that the nugget.ai team have had to make at these stages.

At each stage, Marian and Melissa will work with the whole group in identifying the advantages of nugget.ai’s approach and any areas of opportunities. The participants will be encouraged to reflect on nugget.ai’s business decisions, leaning on lessons that have emerged from the study group’s previous modules.
