Between January and February 2024, we conducted three co-design research sessions in collaboration with another IDRC team that was reviewing the standards development process to identify areas and ways to improve inclusion of people with disabilities to integrate the insights of Canadians with disabilities into the standards development process. Sixteen recommendations under four themes emerged from the co-design. The themes include Capacity building, education, and communication; Diversity and representation; Empowering participation; Decision-making and stakeholder synergy.

## Our approach

Recognizing that "nothing about us without us" is more than a slogan, we sought to empower these individuals as experts, drawing on their lived experiences to critique and contribute to a process often inaccessible to them.

## Challenges and innovations

We faced two significant challenges: demystifying a jargon-heavy, opaque standards process and working within the rigid constraints of established procedures. Our solution? A game-based approach that educated and engaged co-designers in a playful, low-stakes environment, encouraging free idea exchange and creative problem-solving.

## The game

Developed by the IDRC team, the game simulated the standards development journey, from preliminary stages to review and maintenance. It emphasized collaboration, role-playing, and a feedback loop, mirroring real-life scenarios in standard development. Co-designers, embodying roles like researchers and policy makers, used their 'superpowers' to navigate the game, reflecting the diverse contributions necessary for creating inclusive standards.

## Recruitment and compensation

We reached out broadly, seeking a diverse group of co-designers who could bring a wealth of perspectives to the table. Honouring their expertise and time, we provided honorariums, ensuring that their contributions were valued and respected.

## The process

* **Education:** We introduced the basics of the standards process, facilitated by Accessibility Standards Canada, focusing on clarity and inclusivity.
* **Play:** Teams played the game, fostering a sense of community and deepening their understanding of the standards process.
* **Hack:** With familiarity, teams suggested nuanced changes to the game rules, reflecting a sophisticated grasp of the standards ecosystem.

## Outcomes and future directions

Surveys and discussions revealed a desire for more inclusive recruitment for technical committees and early public involvement in the standards process. Transparency in decision-making and diverse committee representation were also highlighted as areas for improvement.

Effective facilitation was identified as key to bridging gaps in ability, participation, and access. Cross-committee communication emerged as a challenge, with a need for up-to-date information sharing and potential harmonization of standards.

This co-design research has not only provided valuable insights into the standards development process but also set a precedent for inclusive, collaborative approaches that honor the expertise of all individuals, particularly those with disabilities.
