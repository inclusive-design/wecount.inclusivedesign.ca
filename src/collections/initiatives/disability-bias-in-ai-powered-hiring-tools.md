  The IDRC is investigating bias in AI-based hiring algorithms by creating a
  data set based on the resumes and experience of real people with disabilities.
  This “synthetic” data set can be used to test hiring algorithms and help us to
  better understand and improve potential bias in these systems. Help is needed
  to build this synthetic data from those who have experienced barriers to
  employment because of a disability.

### Creating Bias-Testing Data from the Experiences of People with Disabilities

The Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC) is seeking individuals with lived experience of disability to help us create a disability-specific data set in an accessible, online co-design.\
\
The IDRC is investigating bias in hiring algorithms that use artificial intelligence (AI) through its [We Count](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/) and [Optimizing Diversity with Disability](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/odd/) (ODD) projects. Our goal is to create a data set based on the resumes and experience of real people with disabilities. This “synthetic” data set can be used to test hiring algorithms and help us to better understand and improve potential bias in these systems.\
\
Help is needed to build this synthetic data from those who have experienced barriers to employment because of a disability. Participants do not need to be employed or unemployed or have prior knowledge of artificial intelligence, privacy protections or hiring tools to participate.\
\
The goal of this accessible, online co-design is to generate a data set of job-seeker information by:

* Creating resumes based on information from real resumes
* Creating cover letters to go with the synthetic resumes

The co-design is structured in two required sessions and a third optional session on resume tips, which will take place over a period of three weeks, from 1-3 PM ET:

1. Session 1 Creating Resumes: Wednesday, March 23, 2022
2. Session 2 Creating Cover Letters: Wednesday, March 30, 2022
3. Resume Tips Seminar: Wednesday, April 13, 2022 (optional)

The total time commitment is expected to be 4 hours for the co-design and 2 hours for the optional seminar. All participants will also receive [We Count micro-badges](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/badges/).
