Between April and May 2024, the Regulating the Digital Domain (RtDD) team continued work with community co-researchers with lived experience of disability to address project challenges. 

## Our approach

Recognizing that “nothing about us without us” is more than a slogan (and in authentic inclusive practice “nothing without us”), we sought to empower individuals as experts, drawing on their lived experiences to critique and contribute to a process often inaccessible to them. Our objectives were to: empower experts in sharing issues and challenges relevant to the project challenges, engage experts in conversations stemming from their issues and challenges, and encourage experts to review the collective research results. 

First, we created three questions that encompassed the six project challenges: 

1. What specific problems have you faced using digital tools or systems like computers, things with screens & buttons or apps on phone?
2. Think about new technologies or apps that didn’t work well for you. What rules should have been in place to make them more accessible?
3. Can you see any problems with rules to make things accessible that don’t say how to do it?

Next, we chose to leverage Canvas a Learning Management System which hosts the RtDD community to support participants in preparing for synchronous discussions about standards development, document the discussions, and reviewing their contributions.

Finally, we chose the research method 1-2-4-All to foster discussion from small groups to progressively larger groups as a way to support each co-researcher having an opportunity to share and discuss. 

## Recruitment and compensation

We recruited co-researchers from our community and list of interested co-researchers. We identified 16 co-researchers out of 149 applicants that would provide a variety of access needs, experiences, languages, regions, and ages. Co-researchers were compensated $250 CAD for their expertise.

## The process and online community

The co-research activities were both synchronous and asynchronous online activities. The process was divided into three online sessions over six weeks:

### Session 1: Learning, Thinking and sharing

In the first week, co-researchers joined RtDD’s Canvas community. We used the discussion forum in Canvas for an asynchronous exchange of ideas, where co-researchers answered questions about digital barriers and regulations that were not prescriptive in how to achieve accessibility. There were three discussion areas:

1. Flexible Standards: What specific problems have you faced using digital tools or systems like computers, things with screens and buttons or apps on the phone?
2. Inclusion and Accessibility: Think about new technologies or apps that didn’t work well for you. What rules should have been in place to make them more accessible?
3. Supporting Innovation: Can you see any problems with rules to make things accessible that don’t say how to do it?

### Session 2: Discussing

The approach of a 1-2-4-All format was to start activities with small groups and increase the group size gradually until everyone was together, building out thinking and ideas as the group grew. For this co-design, we asked co-researchers to individually think about the three discussion questions individually and document their thoughts on Canvas. We then met synchronously on Zoom and in Zoom breakout rooms for co-researchers to share their thoughts in pairs, groups of four, and finally, all together in a group of approximately 16 co-researchers. During the synchronous sessions, facilitators took notes to capture added information and evolving ideas. 

### Session 3: Analysis and review

The asynchronous and synchronous activities produced a great deal of written notes and responses. The RtDD team summarized these texts so that they were organized into themes and recommendations. The final session had co-researchers review and offer feedback on:

* Summaries the team made from the contributions of all co-researchers from Sessions 1 and 2. 
* Draft recommendations for Accessibility Standards Canada (ASC) created by the IDRC team from co-researcher contributions. A plain-language version of the recommendations was also provided. 

The tasks took the form of a survey. Each section had an introduction that reminded the co-researchers of the question discussed and the reason for asking it. Then, each theme was presented one at a time, along with a response field. Co-researchers were prompted to consider whether their perspective was included and accurately represented. If not, we asked them to let us know what they think should change or be added in the response area.

## Analysis and review

The IDRC team then summarized the content generated by the co-researchers on Canvas and during the synchronous sessions and looped co-researchers back into the process to review the summarized information. The summarized information was uploaded to Canvas and organized in groups based on each prompt question. Co-researchers were asked, “Is your perspective is included and accurately represented in the summaries. If it is not, then let us know in the response areas what you think should change or be added” and given opportunity using a quiz format to respond to each section of the analysis.

## Outcomes and future directions

The Regulating the Digital Domain (RtDD) project is a pioneering initiative aimed at enhancing digital inclusion and ICT accessibility for people with disabilities. By assembling a multidisciplinary team of advisors and co-researchers, the project tackles six pivotal challenges to develop a regulatory system that effectively governs the digital landscape. The project’s multi-pronged approach includes engaging individuals with lived experiences of disability, addressing systemic issues with current standards, and exploring innovative solutions to prevent barriers.

Through extensive co-research activities, the RtDD team identified over twenty themes aligned with the project’s six major challenges. These themes highlight the need for diverse and flexible accessibility standards, the importance of keeping pace with technological advancements, and the necessity of fostering innovation while ensuring interoperability of digital systems. The findings emphasize the critical role of involving people with disabilities in the design and development process, promoting empathy and understanding among developers, and creating adaptable and user-friendly digital tools.

The strategies proposed for regulations thus far consolidate these themes into actionable steps, such as establishing advisory boards, implementing dynamic standards, encouraging creative freedom, and ensuring continuous improvement through user feedback. These strategies aim to create a more inclusive digital environment by supporting compliance with standards, promoting accessibility innovation, and empowering people with disabilities.

Moving forward, the RtDD project will continue to work with stakeholders to build on the strategies from the first co-designs and reimagine and iterate on regulatory approaches that address the identified challenges. By doing so, the project aspires to significantly improve digital inclusion and ICT accessibility, ultimately informing Accessibility Standards Canada on alternative practices for creating a more accessible digital world.
