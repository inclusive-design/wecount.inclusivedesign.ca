The IDRC has submitted a proposal to the W3C to establish a Community Group to discuss and develop portable personal data preferences, and it has been approved.  More information about the group can be found on the [W3C community group site](https://www.w3.org/community/prtbl-prsnl-prefs/).

There is a [call for participation](https://www.w3.org/community/prtbl-prsnl-prefs/2021/06/14/call-for-participation-in-portable-personal-data-preferences-community-group/) to join the group.  Note that you will need a W3C account to proceed. Either use your existing account, or create a new one if you are so inclined.
