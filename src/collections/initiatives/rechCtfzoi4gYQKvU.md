### **AI-Powered Mobile Assistive Technology Apps: Risks and Benefits**

Artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing to think like us and to deep dream through machine learning. How can we leverage this technology to improve accessibility, and at the same time, keep up with the ramifications? Inspired by Dr. Roger Melko’s CBC podcast, this three-part workshop will explore and dig deeper into the possibilities of AI-powered assistive technology mobile apps.

This workshop is comprised of three sessions:

**Part 1: Introduction.** In this session, we will provide an overview of the three parts of the workshop, discuss the podcast, and set up the mobile apps (SeeingAI, Supersense, Envision, MapInHood and Ava). Participants will be assigned a mobile app group based on their preferences upon registration.  
Wednesday, September 23, 2020, 10:30 AM – 12:00 PM (EST)

**Part 2: Exploration of Artificial Intelligence Through Assistive Technologies.** In breakout rooms, each group will discuss their assigned mobile app. Through experience of the app, each group will consider the risks and benefits of AI use in assistive technologies as well as the participation of people with lived experience of disability in the design of AT applications.  
Wednesday, October 7, 2020, 10:30 AM – 12:00 PM (EST)

**Part 3: Webinar - Conversation with Dr. Roger Melko.** Groups will discuss their findings with guest speaker Dr. Roger Melko and others as a further exploration of the topic. This webinar session is open for registration to other attendees.  
Wednesday, October 21, 2020, 10:30 AM – 12:00 PM (EST)
