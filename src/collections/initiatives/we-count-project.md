As data becomes the primary basis for determining truth and value, and data science drives the opportunities and risks of our digital economy, people with disabilities are likely to become more and more marginalized if their needs are not considered in this quickly ascending domain. There is a small but quickly closing window to act proactively to curtail the risks and catch the opportunities for people experiencing disabilities.

The current data ecosystem — an evolving system used to collect and analyze data to provide insights into the needs and habits of its users — focuses on the needs of the majority. As people experiencing disabilities are very different from each other, there are no adequate representative sample groups for predictive analytics. Their needs are either not captured in data, eliminated from the data set as outliers, or overwhelmed by majority data. An inclusive and balanced data ecosystem ensures that the needs of its minorities, such as persons with disabilities, are valued and not overlooked.

We Count, a project of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD University, was created to address bias, discrimination and barriers to participation and employment for persons with disabilities within the field of data science and data-driven systems.
