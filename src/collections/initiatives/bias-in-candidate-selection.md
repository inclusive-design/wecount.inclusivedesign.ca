### Addressing Bias in Machine Learning Models on Candidate Selection

In this module, participants will explore policy through a co-design activity, working in groups to co-create approaches to AI and ML challenges in employment systems. Abhishek Gupta will help guide us through this activity. Abhishek will introduce and frame the co-design activity that will engage teams and encourage them to work through practical situations and challenges related to policies and standards around employment, disability and AI.
