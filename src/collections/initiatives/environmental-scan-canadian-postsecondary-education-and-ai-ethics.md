This article provides an overview of key findings from an environmental scan conducted by the We Count team in May 2020. The scan relied on information available through online sources to explore how data ethics are being taught, expressed, and implemented within Canada by three stakeholders in the data ecosystem: Postsecondary Education (PSE) Institutions, [Data Service Providers](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/environmental-scan-assessing-inclusionary-practice-in-canadian-data-services/), and [AI Firms](https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/environmental-scan-addressing-inclusionary-practice-in-canadian-ai-firms/).

{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCjqn3QNmMM" %}

The PSE portion of the environmental scan identified 46 AI-related programs across 29 Canadian PSE institutions and aimed to answer the following questions: Is AI ethics and fairness included in program curriculums? Do any programs address minority groups or outliers?

## **Highlights**

*   30 of 48 identified programs include an ethics course\*
*   17 of 48 identified programs require students to enroll in an ethics course
*   11 of 48 identified programs tackle algorithmic bias, fairness, and social issues\*\*
*   3 of 48 identified programs address minority issues

\*Including broader ethical topics such as privacy, security, and cybercrime

\*\*Including required and elective courses

## **Takeaways**

*   Most AI education is through computer science or data science specializations at all PSE degree levels, including continuing studies
*   The majority of ethical courses that address social implications and fairness are at the graduate level
*   AI ethics is not showing as a priority across programs, with only 17 out of 48 requiring ethics training
*   Bias and minority concerns are not addressed often, even in programs with ethics courses
