We aim to foster an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives contribute to meaningful change and will work with you to make sure that you can participate equitably.

## Event Details:

The co-design process will span 7-8 hours over six weeks. This initiative is part of the Regulating the Digital Domain (RtDD) project, and will inform development of accessible and inclusively designed standards development processes and activities by Accessibility Standards Canada and others.
