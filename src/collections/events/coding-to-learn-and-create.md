### Coding to Learn and Create

Looking for something exciting and creative for your kids in November? Coding to Learn and Create is offering a two-day online workshop that combines creativity and learning to give your children (recommended grade levels 1-6) an experience they won’t forget.

On the first day, kids will learn about the Inclusive Coding Environment and have a chance to try it. Then, they will have one week to explore this coding environment and use it to create artwork. On the second day, kids will showcase their work, collaborate with their peers on building a new art piece and reflect on their experiences of using the Inclusive Coding Environment.

Part 1 - Introduction: November 18, 2020, 10:30 AM – 12:00 PM (EST)  
Part 2 - Workshop: November 25, 2020, 10:30 AM – 12:00 PM (EST)
