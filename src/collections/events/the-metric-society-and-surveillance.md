### The Metric Society and the Unmeasurable

In today’s world, numbers are in the ascendancy. Societies dominated by star ratings, scores, likes and lists are rapidly emerging, as data are collected on virtually every aspect of our lives. From annual university rankings, ratings agencies and fitness tracking technologies to our credit score and health status, everything and everybody is measured and evaluated. Join Steffen Mau, Virginia Eubanks and Jutta Treviranus in conversation for a critical analysis of this increasingly pervasive phenomenon.

**Panelists:**

**Dr. Steffen Mau** works in the fields of comparative welfare research, social inequality and European integration. In his most recent book, *The Metric Society: On the Quantification of the Social*, Steffen Mau shows how metrics have become a form of social conditioning and how the rise of quantification has strengthened social hierarchies.

**Virginia Eubanks** is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University at Albany, SUNY. She is the author of *Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor*; *Digital Dead End: Fighting for Social Justice in the Information Age*; and co-editor, with Alethia Jones, of *Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around: Forty Years of Movement Building with Barbara Smith*. Her writing about technology and social justice has appeared in *Scientific American*, *The Nation*, *Harper’s*, and *Wired*. For two decades, Eubanks has worked in community technology and economic justice movements. She was a founding member of the [Our Data Bodies Project](http://www.odbproject.org/) and a 2016–2017 Fellow at [New America](https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/virginia-eubanks/). She lives in Troy, NY. 

**Jutta Treviranus** is the Director of the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](http://idrc.ocadu.ca) (IDRC) and professor in the faculty of Design at OCAD University. Jutta established the IDRC in 1993 as the nexus of a growing global community that proactively works to ensure that our digitally transformed and globally connected society is designed inclusively. She also heads the [Inclusive Design Institute](https://inclusivedesign.ca), a multi-university regional centre of expertise. Jutta founded an innovative graduate program in inclusive design at OCAD University. She leads international multi-partner research networks that have created broadly implemented innovations that support digital equity. She has played a leading role in developing accessibility legislation, standards and specifications internationally (including [W3C WAI ATAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/), IMS AccessForAll, ISO 24751, and [AODA Information and Communication](https://www.ontario.ca/page/accessibility-legislative-reviews-committees-and-councils)). She serves on many advisory bodies globally to provide expertise in equitable policy design. Jutta’s work has been attributed as the impetus for the corporate adoption of more inclusive practices in large enterprise companies such as [Microsoft](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054927/microsofts-inspiring-bet-on-a-radical-new-type-of-design-thinking) and [Adobe](https://adobe.design/inclusive/).
