## A﻿bout the project

The project Regulating the Digital Domain (RtDD) is looking at the challenges people with disabilities face when interacting with ICT (information and communication technologies) and digital tools. 

During the project the RtDD team will:

* work to uncover what causes barriers, 
* focus on whole systems (not just a localized issue), 
* identify ways to stop barriers or prevent barriers from becoming worse 

The RtDD goal is to improve digital inclusion and ICT accessibility for the full range of PWD (people with disabilities). 

ICT enables users to access, store, transmit, understand, and manipulate information. Digital tools include online platforms and software applications.

To make improvements the project will address the design of a regulatory system focused on regulating the digital domain. 

The project findings will inform Accessibility Standards Canada on greater accessibility to digital tools, content, transactions and/or computer-mediated processes.

## I﻿nforming standards

## **Six challenges addressed with inclusive practices and co-design**

Six challenges will be addressed through a series of co-designs. We will address the following challenges by engaging a wide range of stakeholders with relevant lived experiences and expertise, recognizing that the issues are complex and interrelated. The results will inform the next generation of model accessibility standards in the digital domain. The team will develop strategies that leverage the properties of the digital domain and the approaches needed to ensure greater digital inclusion for people with disabilities.         

The challenges are:

1. How can we meet the diverse and complex accessibility needs of people with disabilities?

   * People with disabilities have more varied needs than people without disabilities. Regulations tend to simplify and generalize these needs, leaving out many people who do not fit the standard criteria. Regulations also limit the potential of digital systems to adapt to individual differences. We need to design for the spectrum of accessibility needs, not just for a checklist of requirements.
2. How can we keep up with the rapid changes in technology and prevent new barriers from emerging?

   * Technology changes faster than standards and regulations. New opportunities and risks arise constantly. Accessibility regulations often clash with the innovation drive that fuels the digital economy. Accessibility compliance is often sacrificed for speed and novelty. We need to find ways to make accessibility a priority in the changing digital landscape, and to prevent new barriers before they become entrenched.
3. How can we ensure integration and interoperability of digital systems and devices?

   * The digital world is interconnected and interdependent. Functionality depends on compatibility. Accessibility regulations have created a separate market for specialized assistive technologies (AT) that often do not work well with mainstream products. This makes digital access more expensive, less functional, and less inclusive for people with disabilities who rely on AT. It also deprives the general public of the benefits of accessible design. We need to promote integration and interoperability of digital systems and devices for everyone.
4. How can we foster accessibility innovation?

   * People with disabilities need innovation, perhaps more than anyone else. However, accessibility regulations often discourage innovation by imposing rigid and outdated standards. We need to encourage accessibility innovation that can address the evolving needs and preferences of people with disabilities.
5. How can we remove disincentives for accessibility compliance?

   * Accessibility regulations have created an industry that profits from the persistence and complexity of accessibility problems. This industry also influences the development of accessibility standards. This creates a conflict of interest that undermines the goal of eliminating barriers and creating inclusive design. We need to remove the disincentives for accessibility compliance and create a culture of accessibility that benefits everyone.
6. How can we empower people with disabilities and their communities?

   * Accessibility regulations often assume that people with disabilities are passive consumers, not active producers, of digital content and technology. They also rely on experts to prescribe, train, and maintain AT systems for people with disabilities. This limits the participation and autonomy of people with disabilities in the digital domain. We need to support people with disabilities as creators, innovators, and decision-makers in the digital world.
