We Count badges enable earners to showcase their proficiency in the growing fields of AI, data systems and inclusive data practices as well as other skills. Badges, once earned, will be owned completely by the earner and can be shared across social media platforms, such as LinkedIn and Instagram, to display their achievement and showcase what has been learned. These badges are designed to address the interests, skills and availability of diverse participants. Earners can expect to work with and learn from a range of experts:

* Industry and public service professionals in data systems
* Technical and research assistants that specialize in data science
* Inclusive design facilitators with expertise in inclusive co-design

The badges fall under a variety of categories, such as Learner, Brainstormer, Collaborator and Communicator, and can be undertaken independently or together as part of a continuing project.

## How are badges earned?

We Count badges are earned by registering with and participating in We Count initiatives or challenges and completing assessments. You can “stack” your badges to earn new badges.

2. Create or open your free CanCred account, which gives you your free badge CanCred Passport for storing your badges
3. Apply for the badge
4. Share your badge

See our [currently available badges](/badges/#earn-a-badge).
