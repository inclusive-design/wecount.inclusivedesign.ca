## Removing bias and exclusion in the data economy

We Count is a community-driven project to address the inherent bias against small minorities and outliers in artificial intelligence and data analytics. Disability often places you at the margins of a data set. More and more critical decisions are made and automated using data. Current artificial intelligence can automate and amplify existing discrimination.

The We Count community is addressing this by:

* making sure people with lived experience of disability can participate in shaping data science,
* addressing data gaps and biases,
* co-designing protections against data abuse and misuse, and
* co-creating more equitable decision supports.
