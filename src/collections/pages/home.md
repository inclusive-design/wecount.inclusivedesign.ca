As the data ecosystem continues to evolve, IDRC is working closely with the disability community and our established network of partners to identify and address key accessibility challenges. Through the We Count website IDRC is sharing sharing current work in inclusive data science, gathering resources, data sets and inclusive data tools, and involving the community through design challenges, workshops and events.



## **Canada’s new national standard for accessible and equitable AI**

We Count Project has highlighted how AI systems often overlook small minorities and outliers — especially people with disabilities. Now, that work has helped shape a national milestone.

The Inclusive Design Research Centre has played a central role in shaping Canada’s leadership in responsible AI. IDRC drafted the new national standard **CAN‑ASC‑6.2:2025 Accessible and Equitable Artificial Intelligence Systems**, with Director **Jutta Treviranus** chairing the technical committee that developed the final version.

Published in **December 2025**, this standard establishes Canada’s first comprehensive requirements for AI systems that are inclusive, transparent, and equitable — especially for people who are most often marginalized by data-driven technologies.

It is now publicly available through **[Accessibility Standards Canada](https://accessible.canada.ca/creating-accessibility-standards/asc-62-accessible-equitable-artificial-intelligence-systems)**, offering guidance for governments, developers, and organizations committed to building AI that serves *all* Canadians.
