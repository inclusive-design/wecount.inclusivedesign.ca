In the expansion of health ecosystems, issues of responsibility and sustainability of the data science involved are central.The idea that these values should be central to the practice of data science is increasingly gaining traction, yet there is noagreement on what exactly makes data science responsible or sustainable because these concepts prove slippery whenapplied to a global field involving commercial, academic and governmental actors. This lack of clarity is causing problemsin setting goals and boundaries for data scientific practice, and risks fundamental disagreement on governance principlesfor this emerging field.
