Modified Abstract: This booklet aims to fill the gaps in information about AI by creating accessible materials that inform communities and allow them to identify what their ideal futures with AI can look like. The path to a fair future starts with the humans behind the machines, not the machines themselves. Self-reflection and a radical transfor-mation of our relationships to our environment and each other are at the heart of combating structural inequality. But understanding what it takes to create a fair and just society is the first step. In creating this booklet, we start from the belief that equity begins with education.
