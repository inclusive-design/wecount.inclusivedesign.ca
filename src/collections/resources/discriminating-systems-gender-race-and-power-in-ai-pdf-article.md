This report is the culmination of a year-long pilot study examining the scale of AIâ€™s current diversity crisis and possible paths forward. This report draws on a thorough review of existing literature and current research working on issues of gender, race, class, and artificial intelligence. The review was purposefully scoped to encompass a variety of disciplinary and methodological perspectives, incorporating literature from computer science, the social sciences, and humanities. It represents the first stage of a multi-year project examining the intersection of gender, race, and power in AI, and will be followed by further studies and research articles on related issues.
