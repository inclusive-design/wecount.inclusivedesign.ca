summary: IDRC's Jutta Treviranus has contributed this article to our FLOE
  project's AI in Education collection, supported by the Hewlett Foundation in
  partnership with Etika Insights. Jutta's article warns that current AI
  systems, powered by statistical reasoning, risk amplifying existing inequities
  and discoursing diversity. Her piece serves as a vital reminder that AI’s
  promise of personalized learning must be balanced against its potential to
  enforce normalization and eliminate valuable differences among learners. The
  AI in Education collection examines AI’s role in education, highlighting both
  opportunities and risks while emphasizing the importance of responsible
  implementation.
