In this paper we investigate the use of a multimodal feature learning approach, using neural network based models such as Skip-gram and Denoising utoencoders, to address sentiment analysis of micro-blogging content, such as Twitter short messages, that are composed by a short text and, possibly, an image.
The approach used in this work is motivated by the recent advances in: i) training language models based on neural networks that have proved to be extremely efficient when dealing with web-scale text corpora, and have shown very good performances when dealing with syntactic and semantic word similarities; ii) unsupervised learning, with neural networks, of robust visual features, that are recoverable from partial observations that may be due to occlusions or noisy and heavily modified images.
We propose a novel architecture that incorporates these neural networks, testing it on several standard Twitter datasets, and showing that the approach is efficient and obtains good classification results.
