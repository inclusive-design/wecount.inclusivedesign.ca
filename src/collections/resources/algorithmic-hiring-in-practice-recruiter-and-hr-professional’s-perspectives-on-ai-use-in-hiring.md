The increasing adoption of AI-enabled hiring software raises questions about the practice of Human Resource (HR) professionals’ use of the software and its consequences. We interviewed 15 recruiters and HR professionals who used AI-enabled hiring software for two decision-making processes in hiring: sourcing and assessment. For both, AI-enabled software allowed the efficient processing of candidate data, thus providing the ability to introduce or advance candidates from broader and more diverse pools. For sourcing, it can serve as a useful learning resource to find candidates. Though, a lack of trust in data accuracy and an inadequate level of control over algorithmic candidate matches can create reluctance to embrace it. For assessment, its implementation varied across companies depending on the industry and the hiring scenario. Its inclusion may redefine HR professionals’ job content as it automates or augments pieces of the existing hiring process. Our research highlights the importance of understanding the contextual factors that shape how algorithmic hiring is practiced in organizations.
