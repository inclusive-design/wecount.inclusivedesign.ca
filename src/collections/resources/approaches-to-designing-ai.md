summary: Teaching Lab's Sarah Johnson has contributed this article to our FLOE
  project's AI in Education collection, supported by the Hewlett Foundation in
  partnership with Etika Insights. Sarah's article emphasizes the importance of
  co-creating AI tools with teachers and students rather than for them, sharing
  valuable lessons from real-world implementations to develop students’ writing
  skills. The AI in Education collection examines AI’s role in education,
  highlighting both opportunities and risks while emphasizing the importance of
  responsible implementation.
