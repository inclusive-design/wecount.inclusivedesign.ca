There have been multiple calls for integrating topics related to fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics (FATE) and social justice into Data Science curricula, but little exploration of how this might work in practice. This paper presents the findings of a collabora-tive auto-ethnography (CAE) engaged in by a MSc Data Science teaching team based at University of Sheffield (UK) Information School where FATE/Critical Data Studies (CDS) topics have been acore part of the curriculum since 2015/16. In this paper, we adopt the CAE approach to reflect on our experiences of working at the intersection of disciplines, and our progress and future plans for integrating FATE/CDS into the curriculum. We identify a series of challenges for deeper FATE/CDS integration related to our own competencies and the wider socio-material context of Higher Education in the UK. We conclude with recommendations for ourselves and the wider FATE/CDS orientated Data Science community.
