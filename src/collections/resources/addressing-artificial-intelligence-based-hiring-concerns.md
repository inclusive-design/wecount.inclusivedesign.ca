summary: With the increased use of AI, the technology has been brought into
  scrutiny because of legal and ethical concerns and also because they have
  traditionally operated as “black boxes.” Thus, it has animated jurisdictions
  to enact legislation to protect job candidates. With legal intervention,
  however, AI companies seem to have softened their stance and are becoming more
  transparent.
