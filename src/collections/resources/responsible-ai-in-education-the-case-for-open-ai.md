summary: OpenStax's Richard Baraniuk has contributed this article to our FLOE
  project's AI in Education collection, supported by the Hewlett Foundation in
  partnership with Etika Insights. Richard's article advocates for designing AI
  tools to support teachers rather than replace them, enabling educators to
  focus on mentorship while technology handles routine tasks. He argues that
  building AI on open, equitable foundations is essential to prevent amplifying
  existing inequalities. The AI in Education collection examines AIâ€™s role in
  education, highlighting both opportunities and risks while emphasizing the
  importance of responsible implementation.
