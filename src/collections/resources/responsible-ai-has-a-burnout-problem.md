summary: Companies are under increasing pressure from regulators and activists
  to ensure that their AI products are developed in a way that mitigates
  potential harms. But responsible AI teams often lack support, which can leave
  people in these teams feeling undervalued, affecting their mental health and
  leading to burnout.
