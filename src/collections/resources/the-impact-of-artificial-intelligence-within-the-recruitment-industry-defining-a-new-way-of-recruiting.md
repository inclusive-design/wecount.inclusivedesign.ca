This paper set out to consider artificial intelligence (AI) and the impact its growing influence is having within the recruitment industry. This research considered how AI is influencing employers and candidates, specifically throughout the initial stages of the recruitment process. With limited academic research conducted to date, AI has been accepted, by practicing recruitment specialists, as being “game-changing for HR” (May, 2016, p.6). The overarching aim of this research was to make recommendations on how recruitment processes could be changed, for the better, in recognition of the introduction of AI technology.
