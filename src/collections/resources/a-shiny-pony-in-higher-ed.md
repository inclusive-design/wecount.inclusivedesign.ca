summary: IDRC's Jess Mitchell has contributed this article to our FLOE project's
  AI in Education collection, supported by the Hewlett Foundation in partnership
  with Etika Insights. Jess's article serves as a sobering reminder that AI,
  while powerful, lacks understanding, learning and moral judgment. She calls
  for institutions to focus on people rather than profit or technology. The AI
  in Education collection examines AIâ€™s role in education, highlighting both
  opportunities and risks while emphasizing the importance of responsible
  implementation.
