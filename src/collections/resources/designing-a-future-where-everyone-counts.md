summary: Jutta Treviranus pushes back against cultures, policies, and
  technologies designed only for those deemed "normal." As founder and director
  of the IDRC, she works to challenge and improve the way we build software,
  make large scale decisions, and govern. If only the majority matters, she
  says, innovation is stifled and there will always be people left marginalized.
