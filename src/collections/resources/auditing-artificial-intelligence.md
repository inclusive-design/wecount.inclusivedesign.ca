There are many potential challenges for IT auditors preparing to equip themselves to audit artificial intelligence (AI). But solutions do exist that can transform challenges into successes. This white paper focuses on what auditors need to know as they prepare to focus on AI. It explores the definition of AI, describes the challenges of auditing AI, and discusses how the current version of COBIT® (COBIT® 2019) can be leveraged to audit AI. Additionally, it identifies other frameworks that are also relevant today. Auditors will explore initial keys to successfully auditing AI and uncover relevant references.
