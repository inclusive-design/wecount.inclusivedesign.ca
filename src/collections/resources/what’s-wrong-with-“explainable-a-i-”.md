summary: "Explainable AI has an explainability problem, especially in
  healthcare. Explainable AI methods being sold by companies are often faulty
  and misleading, and they reveal a larger problem: deep learning algorithms
  used in healthcare settings are rarely subjected to rigorous testing, such as
  the approval process for prescription drugs."
