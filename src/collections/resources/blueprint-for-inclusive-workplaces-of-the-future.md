How, when and where people work is evolving rapidly. More than ever there is a need for the workplace to merge the benefits of technology with the talents of people in a manner that is adaptable, human-centered and inclusive. G3ict partnered with Steelcase to conduct quantitative and qualitative research to release a blueprint for Inclusive Workplaces of the Future. The organizations are making the blueprint publicly available with the goal of advancing the conversation about how to create inclusive, safe and compelling workplaces in organizations around the world.
