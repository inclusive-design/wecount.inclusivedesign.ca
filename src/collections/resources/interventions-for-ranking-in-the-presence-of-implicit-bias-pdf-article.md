summary: |-
  This paper considers a type of constraint-based interventions for re-ordering biased rankings derived from utilities with systematic biases against a particular socially salient group. The goal of these interventions is to recover the unbiased ranking that would have resulted from the true latent (unbiased) utilities.

Implicit bias is the unconscious attribution of particular qualities(or lack thereof ) to a member from a particular social group (e.g.,defined by gender or race). Studies on implicit bias have shown that these unconscious stereotypes can have adverse outcomes in various social contexts, such as job screening, teaching, or policing. Recently, [33] considered a mathematical model for implicit bias and showed the effectiveness of the Rooney Rule as a constraint to improve the utility of the outcome for certain cases of the sub-set selection problem. Here we study the problem of designing interventions for the generalization of subset selection – ranking– that requires to output an ordered set and is a central primitive in various social and computational contexts. We present a family of simple and interpretable constraints and show that they can optimally mitigate implicit bias for a generalization of the model studied by Kleinberg and Raghavan. Subsequently, we prove that under natural distributional assumptions on the utilities of items, simple, Rooney Rule-like, constraints can also surprisingly recover almost all the utility lost due to implicit biases. Finally, we augment our theoretical results with empirical findings on real-world distributions from the IIT-JEE (2009) dataset and the Semantic Scholar Research corpus.
