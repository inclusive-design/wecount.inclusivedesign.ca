summary: AI models used in medicine can suffer from inaccuracies and
  inconsistencies, in part because the data used to train the models are often
  not representative of real-world settings. A new MIT study assesses the impact
  that discriminatory AI models can have, especially for systems that are
  intended to provide advice in urgent situations.
