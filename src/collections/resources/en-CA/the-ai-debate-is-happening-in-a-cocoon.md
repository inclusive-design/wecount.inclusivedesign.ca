summary: In this Atlantic article, Amba Kak and Sarah Myers West from the AI Now
  Institute point out how discussions about AI are often far removed from how
  it's actually used in today’s world, and they discuss how AI already poses
  economic and physical threats that disproportionately harm society’s most
  vulnerable people.
