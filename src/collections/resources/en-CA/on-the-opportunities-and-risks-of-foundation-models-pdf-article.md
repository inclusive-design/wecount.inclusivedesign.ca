AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are
trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these
models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report
provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their
capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles
(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their
applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic
and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based
on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,
and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides
powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the
adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,
we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even
capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical
research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.
