summary: This article reviews the five guiding principles for the use of AI. The
  authors speculate that the blueprint offers the Biden administration a
  reasonable alternative to legislation that might be difficult to get through
  congress. The blueprint, it is hoped, will be influential through "guidance,
  rulemaking and enforcement," with several government agencies already
  developing best practices.
