summary: "A Google AI research project that aims to collect speech samples from people with dysarthric speech to improve speech recognition models. "

For millions of people around the world whose speech is difficult for others to understand, face-to-face communication can be very challenging.

Using voice activated technologies can be frustrating as well. While tools like Google Home or the Google Assistant can help people call someone or adjust lighting or music, they may not work as efficiently or accurately for those with impaired voices. This is due to the fact that speech recognition algorithms have heard millions of examples from people whose voices sound “typical,” but not many examples from people with speech impairments.

Ultimately, we hope to improve peoples’ independence and ability to communicate by making technology work better for everyone.  Our first goal is to gather enough voice recordings from people with speech impairments to train speech recognition models to better understand people these voices.
