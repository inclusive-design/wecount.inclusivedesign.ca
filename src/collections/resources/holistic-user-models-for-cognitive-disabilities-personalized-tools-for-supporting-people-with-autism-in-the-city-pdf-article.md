summary: "The PIUMA (Personalized Interactive Urban Maps for Autism) project has
  the goal of developing a set of personalized solutions that account for the
  ASD individual's idiosyncrasies, helping them move across the city where they
  live and improving their autonomy when moving and managing everyday
  activities.  "

This paper presents a personalized interactive map aimed at supporting people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in their daily transfers within urban environments. To this end, it aims to model a “complete” representation of the ASD individual by merging a variety of information in a unique user model. Moreover, it exploits crowdsourcing mechanisms to enrich the representation of places that may be considered “safe” by ASD people. As a result, the system is specifically designed for helping them manage stress originated by breakdowns from “spatial routines”, by providing recommendations about safe places to reach and giving personalized tools to manage unexpected events.
