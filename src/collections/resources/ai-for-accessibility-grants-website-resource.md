AI for Accessibility amplifies human capability through grants, investments of technology, and expertise. We are looking for individuals or teams who are not only passionate about making the world more inclusive, but also firmly rooted in the communities they intend to benefit. We want to invest in ideas that are developed by or with people with disabilities.
