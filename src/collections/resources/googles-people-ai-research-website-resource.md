People + AI Research (PAIR) is a multidisciplinary team at Google that explores the human side of AI by doing fundamental research, building tools, creating design frameworks, and working with diverse communities. We believe that for machine learning to achieve its positive potential, it needs to be participatory, involving the communities it affects and guided by a diverse set of citizens, policy-makers, activists, artists and more.
