summary: The author explores the bias that plagues AI recruiting. Forty percent
  of companies that use AI claim that it removes unconscious bias, but that
  claim assumes that the robots have been taught to eschew all forms of bias,
  which is not the case. The writer avers that nothing can perpetuate bias other
  than AI. And while AI didn’t create bias, “it took it viral.”
