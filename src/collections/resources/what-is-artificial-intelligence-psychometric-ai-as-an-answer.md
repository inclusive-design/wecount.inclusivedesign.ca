We propose an answer to the “What is AI?” question, namely, that AI is really (or at least really ought in significant part to be) Psychometric AI (PAI). Along the way, we: set out and rebut five objections to PAI; describe PERI, a robot in our lab who exemplifies PAI; and briefly treat the future of Psychometric AI, first by pointing toward some promising PAI-based applications, and then by raising some of the “big” philosophical questions the success of Psychometric AI will raise.
