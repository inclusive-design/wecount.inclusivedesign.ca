summary: Equity Unbound and American University Cairo's Maha Bali has
  contributed this article to our FLOE project's AI in Education collection,
  supported by the Hewlett Foundation in partnership with Etika Insights. Maha's
  article advocates for institutionally supported development of AI literacies
  rather than expecting overworked teachers to learn independently. The AI in
  Education collection examines AIâ€™s role in education, highlighting both
  opportunities and risks while emphasizing the importance of responsible
  implementation.
