Human-level artificial intelligence (HAI) surely is a special research endeavor in more than one way: In the first place, the very nature of intelligence is not entirely clear; there are no criteria commonly agreed upon necessary or sufficient for the ascription of intelligence other than similarity to human performance (and even this criterion is open for a plethora of possible interpretations); there is a lack of clarity concerning how to properly investigate HAI and how to proceed after the very first steps of implementing an HAI system; etc. In this note I assess the ways in which the approach of Psychometric Artificial Intelligence can (and cannot) be taken as a foundation for a scientific approach to HAI.
