summary: This article brings into focus the dilemma faced by companies relying
  on AI technology. Although there is a multitude of jobs available companies
  are struggling to find the right talent, which indicates that AI technology is
  rejecting far too many qualified applicants. There is also the challenge of
  deploying the technology in a non-discriminatory way and the lack of audit and
  proper legal oversight, which has lagged behind the rapid advancement of the
  technology.
