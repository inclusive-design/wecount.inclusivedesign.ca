Rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and increased reliance upon AI by both governments and the private sector have led to rising concern about potential negative implications for human dignity, democratic accountability, and the bedrock principles of free societies. We need a global governance framework to address the wide range of societal challenges associated with AI, including threats to privacy, information access, and the right to equal protection and nondiscrimination. Rather than working to develop new frameworks from scratch, we argue that the challenges associated with AI can best be confronted by drawing onthe existing international human-rights framework.
