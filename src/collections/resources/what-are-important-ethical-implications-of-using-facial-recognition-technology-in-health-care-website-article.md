summary: "Facial recognition technology (FRT) is attractive for a variety of healthcare applications, but its use also raises ethical questions about privacy and data protection, potential bias, and potential implications for patient-clinician relationships. "

Applications of facial recognition technology (FRT) in health care settings have been developed to identify and monitor patients as well as to diagnose genetic, medical, and behavioral conditions. The use of FRT in health care suggests the importance of informed consent, data input and analysis quality, effective communication about incidental findings, and potential influence on patient-clinician relationships. Privacy and data protection are thought to present challenges for the use of FRT for health applications.
