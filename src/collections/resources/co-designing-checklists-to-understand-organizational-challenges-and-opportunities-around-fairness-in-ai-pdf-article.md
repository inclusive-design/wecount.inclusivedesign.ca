Many organizations have published principles intended toguide the ethical development and deployment of AI systems;however, their abstract nature makes them difficult to oper-ationalize. Some organizations have therefore produced AIethics checklists, as well as checklists for more specific con-cepts, such as fairness, as applied to AI systems. But unlesschecklists are grounded in practitioners’ needs, they may bemisused. To understand the role of checklists in AI ethics, weconducted an iterative co-design process with 48 practitioners,focusing on fairness. We co-designed an AI fairness checklistand identified desiderata and concerns for AI fairness check-lists in general. We found that AI fairness checklists couldprovide organizational infrastructure for formalizing ad-hocprocesses and empowering individual advocates. We discussaspects of organizational culture that may impact the efficacyof such checklists, and highlight future research directions
