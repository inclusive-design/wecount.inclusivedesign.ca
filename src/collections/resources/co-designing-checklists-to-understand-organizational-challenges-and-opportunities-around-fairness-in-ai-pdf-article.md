Many organizations have published principles intended toguide the ethical development and deployment of AI systems;however, their abstract nature makes them difficult to oper-ationalize. Some organizations have therefore produced AIethics checklists, as well as checklists for more specific con-cepts, such as fairness, as applied to AI systems. But unlesschecklists are grounded in practitionersâ€™ needs, they may bemisused. To understand the role of checklists in AI ethics, weconducted an iterative co-design process with 48 practitioners,focusing on fairness. We co-designed an AI fairness checklistand identified desiderata and concerns for AI fairness check-lists in general. We found that AI fairness checklists couldprovide organizational infrastructure for formalizing ad-hocprocesses and empowering individual advocates. We discussaspects of organizational culture that may impact the efficacyof such checklists, and highlight future research directions
