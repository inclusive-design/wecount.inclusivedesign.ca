Throughout history, people with disabilities have been stigmatized and considered inferior by many able-bodied people. People with disabilities struggle daily to obtain the same rights and opportunities as able-bodied people in every aspect of their lives. Employment is a specific area in which people with disabilities tend to face massive amounts of discrimination. Many employers fail to recognize the potential of candidates with disabilities and judge them based solely on their disability without considering things like their experience or qualifications.
