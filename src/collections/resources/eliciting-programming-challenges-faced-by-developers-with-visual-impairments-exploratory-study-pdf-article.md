Without understanding the programming difficulties faced by developers with visual impairments, the research community cannot begin to work on effective solutions to overcome these potential problems. This paper will describe our initial empirically based study to identify the problems blind software developers face. We analyzed 69 survey responses with blind developers in an effort to identify the aspects that are indeed a challenge to software development. The results indicate a number of difficulties, workarounds, and basis requirements that will serve as domain and stakeholder understand.
