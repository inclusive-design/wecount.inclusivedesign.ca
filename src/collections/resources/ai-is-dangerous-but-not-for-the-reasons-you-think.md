summary: In this Ted Talk, AI ethics researcher Sasha Luccioni explains that we
  need to focus on AI's current negative impacts, like emitting carbon,
  infringing copyrights and spreading biased information, rather than getting
  distracted by future existential risks. She suggests inclusive and transparent
  solutions to regulate our AI-filled future.
