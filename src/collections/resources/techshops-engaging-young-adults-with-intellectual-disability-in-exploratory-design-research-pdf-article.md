This case study presents “TechShops”, a collaborative workshop-based approach to learning about technologies with Young Adults with Intellectual Disability (YAID) in exploratory design research. The “TechShops” approach emerged because we found it difficult to engage YAID in traditional contextual interviews. Hence, we offered a series of “TechShops”, which we found useful in: enabling engagement with participants, their families and support staff; fostering relationships; and gaining research access. We explain the context of “TechShops”, and reflect upon the opportunities and challenges that the approach offers for both researchers and YAID in exploratory design research.
