summary: Meta is developing a new app that transcribes speech into text in the
  real world using AR, which could be a game changer for people who are hard of
  hearing or deaf. The live-captioning technology displays captions on top of
  the person speaking via wearables, focusing only on the identified speaker's
  voice, and it even works in crowded spaces.
