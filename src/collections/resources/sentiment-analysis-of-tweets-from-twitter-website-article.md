summary: "Overview and insights from a project that determines the sentiment analysis of Twitter data sets using a multimodal feature learning approach. "
---
The project investigates the use of a multimodal feature learning approach, using neural network based models such as Skip-gram and Denoising Autoencoders, to address sentiment analysis of micro-blogging content, such as Twitter short messages, that are composed by a short text and, possibly, an image.

A novel architecture that incorporates neural networks is proposed and tested on several standard Twitter datasets, showing that the approach is efficient and obtains good classification results.
