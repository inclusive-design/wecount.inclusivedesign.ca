summary: Algorithmic audits are an increasingly popular mechanism for
  algorithmic accountability. But without a clear understanding of audit
  practices, AI audit claims are difficult to verify and may potentially
  exacerbate, rather than mitigate, bias and harm. To address this, the AJL has
  completed a field scan of the AI audit ecosystem and has shared their findings
  in a video overview of their new paper.
