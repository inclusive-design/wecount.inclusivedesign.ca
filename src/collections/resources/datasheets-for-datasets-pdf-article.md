The machine learning community currently has no standardized process for docu-menting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains. Toaddress this gap, we proposedatasheets for datasets. In the electronics industry, everycomponent, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet thatdescribes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other infor-mation. By analogy, we propose that every dataset be accompanied with a datasheetthat documents its motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses,and so on. Datasheets for datasets will facilitate better communication between datasetcreators and dataset consumers, and encourage the machine learning community toprioritize transparency and accountability
