summary: This is the full text of CAN-ASC-6.2:2025- Accessible and Equitable
  Artificial Intelligence Systems--a national standard in Canada.
---
This  Standard is the framework of a multi-part standard. It is intended to create a high-level structure for future parts, as well as address automated decision tools that preceded large language models and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

It is the diversity of people with disabilities in systems designed to favour statistical averages that warrants the urgency of this standard. While compliance to Standards is best supported by testable, technically precise specifications, the requirements, necessary protections and contexts of use of AI by people with disabilities are variable and in flux. Technical precision would not address this diversity, nor would it keep pace with the changes in the field of AI. This Standard is designed to support contextual adaptability to the diversity of applications and requirements of people with disabilities. This Standard emphasizes process and intended outcomes and will be supported by more precise technical guidance.
