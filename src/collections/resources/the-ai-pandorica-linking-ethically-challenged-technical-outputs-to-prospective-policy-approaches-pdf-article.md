Artificial intelligence increasingly drives the modern world. Its rapid and continuous integration into the economic and political fabric of societies across the globe has placed the ethical challenges associated with A.I. onto national political agendas. This paper will deconstruct both the technical and regulatory challenges wrought by A.I. through an ethical lens. By providing a brief overview of how modern A.I. works, and defining and mapping its associated ethical issues to specific technical outputs, this paper will explore several promising paths forward.
