  literacy and geography. "

We share two prototypes that explore different aspects of
the design and application of inclusive AI. This approach to
inclusive AI Design seeks to engage typically excluded
communities, such as individuals of varying socioeconomic
status, race, age, gender (and those who do not identify with
a gender), as well as to critique and explore alternatives to
conventional AI Design.
