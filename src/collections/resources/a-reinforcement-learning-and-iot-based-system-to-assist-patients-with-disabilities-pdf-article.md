One of the important aspect of clinical process is to complete treatment according to given plan. The successful completion of this task is more challenging when a person have some physical or mental disability and requires resources and man power for personalized treatment and care. We can mitigate this problem by an intelligent guidance and monitoring system who can assist elderly persons and patients in their treatment schedule. Reinforcement learning and IoT systems have received considerable credit of significant contribution in healthcare over last few years, could be suitable choice for said objective. We propose a pill reminder system using Bayesian reinforcement learning assisted with IoT devices to help people (having mental and/or physical disability) in their treatment plan. The proposed intelligent system is able to successfully communicate with the person through a suitable audio, visual and textual message. The proposed pill-reminder system has been demonstrated for a specific treatment plan of a hypertension patient.
