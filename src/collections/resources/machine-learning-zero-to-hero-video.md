This is a talk for people who know code, but who don’t necessarily know machine learning. Learn the ‘new’ paradigm of machine learning, and how models are an alternative implementation for some logic scenarios, as opposed to writing if/then rules and other code. This session will guide you through understanding many of the new concepts in machine learning that you might not be familiar with including eager mode, training loops, optimizers, and loss functions.
