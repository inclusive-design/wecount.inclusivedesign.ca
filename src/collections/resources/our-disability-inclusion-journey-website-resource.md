A Message from Microsoftâ€™s Chief

Accessibility Officer

Technology can empower people to achieve more, help strengthen education
opportunities, and make the workplace more inviting and inclusive for people
with disabilities. And with more than one billion people with disabilities in the
world, Microsoft believes accessibility and inclusion are essential to delivering
on our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet
to achieve more. We are on a journey and continue to learn and grow as we move forward. We hope by sharing what we've learned, other organizations can build out and accelerate their disability inclusion programs, hire great talent, and reduce the
unemployment rate for people with disabilities.  Game on!
