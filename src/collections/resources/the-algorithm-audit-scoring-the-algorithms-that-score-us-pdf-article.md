In recent years, the ethical impact of AI has been increasingly scrutinized, with public scandals emerging over biased
outcomes, lack of transparency, and the misuse of data. This has led to a growing mistrust of AI and increased calls for
mandated ethical audits of algorithms. Current proposals for ethical assessment of algorithms are either too high level to
be put into practice without further guidance, or they focus on very specific and technical notions of fairness or
transparency that do not consider multiple stakeholders or the broader social context. In this article, we present an
auditing framework to guide the ethical assessment of an algorithm. The audit instrument itself is comprised of three
elements: a list of possible interests of stakeholders affected by the algorithm, an assessment of metrics that describe key
ethically salient features of the algorithm, and a relevancy matrix that connects the assessed metrics to stakeholder
interests. The proposed audit instrument yields an ethical evaluation of an algorithm that could be used by regulators
and others interested in doing due diligence, while paying careful attention to the complex societal context within which
the algorithm is deployed.
