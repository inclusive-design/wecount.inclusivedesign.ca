### **22nd-Century Proto-Typing: Strategies for Building Indigenous Future Imaginaries**

Based on Jason Lewis’s research-creation work over the last two decades, this webinar will explore the concept of the future imaginary and make an argument as to why it is important that Indigenous people engage in creating them. Drawing on material from the Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace research network, the Initiative for Indigenous Futures partnership, the Illustrating the Future Imaginary commissions, the Skins Workshops on Aboriginal Storytelling and Video Game Design, and the Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Working Group, Lewis will discuss the strategies that his collaborators and he have developed for articulating desired futures, and building the capacity to make them real.
